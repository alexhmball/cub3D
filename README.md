# cub3D - Exploring RayCasting 

The cub3D project offered a thrilling opportunity for me to venture into the captivating world of 3D graphics and game development. Inspired by the iconic game Wolfenstein 3D, this project challenged me to create a realistic 3D graphical representation of a maze from a first-person perspective using the RayCasting principles, particularly the Digital Differential Analyzer (DDA) algorithm.

## Learning Goals
Throughout the cub3D project, my primary focus was on the following learning goals, with a strong emphasis on RayCasting and the DDA algorithm:

1. **RayCasting Principles:** I immersed myself in the foundational principles of RayCasting, a classic technique used in early first-person shooters. Understanding how RayCasting works was crucial to creating a 3D illusion within a 2D environment.

2. **Digital Differential Analyzer (DDA) Algorithm:** I dived deep into the DDA algorithm, a rasterization method that efficiently calculates the intersections of rays with walls in a grid-based maze. Implementing DDA was the key to rendering the maze walls correctly.

3. **Graphics Fundamentals:** I grasped essential graphics concepts, such as color representation, window management, and texture rendering. These concepts were fundamental in creating an immersive 3D environment.

4. **MiniLibX Library:** I explored and mastered the MiniLibX library, an invaluable tool for graphics manipulation and event handling. Leveraging MiniLibX allowed me to focus on the core aspects of the project.

5. **File Parsing:** I developed robust file parsing skills to read and interpret scene description files with the .cub extension. Accurate parsing was critical in extracting maze information and texture paths.

6. **Keyboard and Mouse Events:** Implementing keyboard and mouse event handling empowered users to navigate the maze and interact with the game. A smooth and intuitive user experience was essential.

7. **Wall Texturing:** I experimented with different wall textures to create an engaging visual experience. Varying wall textures based on their orientations (North, South, East, West) enhanced realism.

8. **Error Handling and Memory Management:** I prioritized effective error handling to gracefully handle misconfigurations and ensure the program's smooth termination. Proper memory management prevented memory leaks.

## Reflection
The cub3D project presented a thrilling opportunity to explore the fascinating world of 3D graphics and game development. My main focus lay in mastering the RayCasting technique and implementing the DDA algorithm to render the maze walls accurately. Understanding the underlying mathematics and algorithms was crucial to achieving a convincing 3D illusion.

The DDA algorithm's efficiency and simplicity made it an excellent choice for calculating intersections between rays and maze walls in real-time. As I progressed through the project, I experienced significant growth in my programming and problem-solving skills.

By completing the cub3D project, I gained a deeper understanding of graphics algorithms, mathematics, and how they come together to create immersive gaming experiences. Additionally, mastering the MiniLibX library provided valuable insights into graphics manipulation and event handling, essential skills for any aspiring game developer.

As I embarked on this exciting journey, I felt inspired by the pioneers of the gaming industry, such as John Carmack and John Romero, who laid the foundation for modern first-person shooters. I was eager to apply their groundbreaking techniques to create my own cub3D game and take my programming skills to new heights.
